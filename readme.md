# html2apk

Do you have ready a **html5 / javascript** application (plain, jquery, vue, angular, react) and you want to compile it to **APK** ? This is the freeware solution versus :

* [DecSoft App Builder](https://www.decsoftutils.com/appbuilder/) (trial) which asking you to install apache cordova (as result you get `2mb` for a `hello world`) 
* [website2apk](https://websitetoapk.com/) (trial) you get `1mb` for a `hello world`  
* [GameDev_ToolMaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1463740/HTML_2_APK_Compiler/) (unreleased trial) you get `1.2mb` for a `hello world`
